1548171735 #jsapi Brainstorming with arai best way to introduce and land a manner of producing deliberately-broken ASTs for testing.
1548174445 #jsapi Measuring myself the size of a few files. With optimal dictionary, I get x1.02-x1.1 wrt Brotli on frameworks.
1548252508 #jsapi Wasting time with Workday.
1548254007 #jsapi Attempting to diagnose Bug 1521980 - moz-phab freezing during submission of potentially large commit
1548255780 #jsapi More tests for entropy 0.2
1548272681 #jsapi Re-measuring Facebook compression with Entropy 0.2 and optimal dictionary, I get Brotli x 0.92
1548338188 #jsapi Early prototype of fallback dictionary generator.
1548361729 #jsapi Bug 1521980 moz-phab freezing during submission when a diff contains binary files - investigating. Fun fact: ~4Mb in the patch seem to be the full content of files being *removed*.
1548408210 #jsapi Bug 1522759 I'm still alive and I'd like to land patches :) - filed
1548409053 #jsapi Bug 1522756 - Make it possible to encode specific files to BinAST, and add description - reviewed
1548409184 #jsapi Bug 1522756 - Part 2: Add README.md to js/src/jit-test/tests/binast/ - reviewed
1548409481 #jsapi  Bug 1522754 Intermittent make[3]: *** [force-cargo-host-program-build] Error 101 | After recipe for target 'force-cargo-host-program-build' failed - investigating
1548422579 #jsapi Produced prototype baseline dictionary. That's 114744 states :/
1548430271 #jsapi First roundtrips with baseline dictionary.
1548445671 #jsapi Compression results with Entropy 0.3 for Facebook samples seem to match the experience with framework samples, both in the optimal case (optimal dictionary – size unaffected wrt Entropy 0.2) and in the worst case (no/inapplicable dictionary – size = Brotli x 1.5)
1548449960 #jsapi Preparing for FOSDEM.
1548772395 #jsapi Ahah, made Entropy 0.3 muuuuuuch faster.
