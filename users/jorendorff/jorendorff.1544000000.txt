1544574154 #jsapi 74% done with a manual trawl through the whole of Stream.cpp for bug 1504464
1544630255 #jsapi reviewed a rather amazing patch in bug 1512989 to fix up an entire giant test suite (browser js/src/tests) that was silently not reporting errors for the better part of a year
1544657259 #jsapi reviews in bug 1513040
1544661294 #jsapi finished audit for bug 1504464, but still need to shape the changes into coherent patches.
1544747094 #jsapi triage; a few reviews; bury Waldo in mostly trivial patch reviews for bug 1504464; file bug 1514051; finally get something workable posted for bug 1513570 (feels good); which sounds like a lot but does not move the ball much :-\
