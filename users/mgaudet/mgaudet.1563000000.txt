1563308891 #jsapi My patch is in better shape than I thought.... it actually passes some test cases; just not the one I was using for development.
1563308914 #jsapi Reduced test case to ease investigation of failures.
1563386142 #jsapi Fixed my delazification problem; issue was the exact same flavour as last time, use-after-free of a stack allocated vector because I'm bad at C++ and C++ is bad at being helpful.
1563393856 #jsapi Patch has ghosts. (Passes with flying colours in --debug; suspecting memory issues.)
1563393885 #jsapi (implied, but not stated, fails in --enable-optimize, hence ghosts and memory suspicion)
1563398693 #jsapi Thanks UBSan for pointing out my ghost, an uninitialized member that I fixed in an earlier debugging patch that I promptly pruned after not needing it anymore.
1563463731 #jsapi deferred lazy script initialization works in a lot of cases now. Current issues is with asm.js
1563561329 #jsapi Deferred lazyscripts work (on my machine), up for feedback, then will probably start eyeballing deferred function allocation.
1563822769 #jsapi Cleaned up LazyScript toStringEnd a bit, fixing the one failing test case I know of for deferred lazy script initialization. Onwared to function.
1563828698 #jsapi Trying to get a 32 bit build up and running. First time in a long time, and apparently my setup has rotted.
1563905898 #jsapi internet problems for an internet company
1563909944 #jsapi landed a number of patches, put up a pair of cleanup patches up for review.
