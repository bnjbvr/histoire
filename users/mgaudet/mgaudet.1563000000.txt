1563308891 #jsapi My patch is in better shape than I thought.... it actually passes some test cases; just not the one I was using for development.
1563308914 #jsapi Reduced test case to ease investigation of failures.
1563386142 #jsapi Fixed my delazification problem; issue was the exact same flavour as last time, use-after-free of a stack allocated vector because I'm bad at C++ and C++ is bad at being helpful.
1563393856 #jsapi Patch has ghosts. (Passes with flying colours in --debug; suspecting memory issues.)
