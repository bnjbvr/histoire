1571176656 #jsapi Tracked down a bug I introduced right near the beginning of my patch stack that was caught by only one test. Good test :)
1571248699 #jsapi Desperately trying not to boil the ocean with this patch, but the cut points aren't always super obvious.
1571253984 #jsapi Considering re-inventing moving GC concepts... maybe I should reconsider things... :S
1571265987 #jsapi boiling ocean, or so it feels, while seeking a fixed point for this refactoring. Even more irritatingly, this work probably was going to have to be done eventually; I was just hoping to put it off.
1571328016 #jsapi Splitting things into their own headers while developing this patch seemed like the right choice at the time. The umpteenth circular dependency is making me question my choices.
1571349464 #jsapi Grumbling about https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/ebe492edacc75bb122a2b380e4cafcca3470864c/js/src/vm/Scope.cpp#672 and subsequent implications
1571352551 #jsapi Procrastinating by figuring out suspend / resume in Linux
1571432666 #jsapi Whelp, it's not landable, horribly GC unsafe, and probably broken on the second test case I try it on... but I successfully deferred allocation of one function scope.
