1566422556 #jsapi Attempted to solve the branch relaxation issue by moving SSA values from parameters into the dependent block. Unfortunately post-regalloc the CFG isn't really SSA: there are hidden invariants like diversions that need maintenance.
1566507893 #jsapi Started work on a regalloc-specific branch_folding phase. I believe this will solve the issues with the general approach. It looks promising thus far.
